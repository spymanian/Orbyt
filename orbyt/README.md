# 🌌 Orbyt — CodeAtlas for Your Codebase

**Orbyt** transforms your repository into a **living galaxy** where every file, class, and dependency becomes part of a visual map.  
Explore your codebase like a city — **files are buildings, functions are rooms, and imports are roads** — and let **Gemini AI** explain your code in three levels of understanding.

## ✨ Features

### 🗺️ Visual Code Mapping
Turn your entire repository into an interactive map powered by **Graphology** and **Sigma.js**:
- Each **file/module** → a building  
- Each **function/class** → a room  
- Each **dependency/import** → a bridge  
- Each **folder/cluster** → a constellation  

### 🧠 AI-Powered File Explanations
Click any file node to instantly generate a **3-level explanation** using Google Gemini:
1️⃣ **ELI5** – Explain it like I’m five  
2️⃣ **Intermediate** – What it does  
3️⃣ **Technical** – Deep technical summary  

### 💬 Ask Gemini (Chatbot Mode)
Chat directly with Gemini to understand your project:
> “Where does this repo handle authentication?”  
> “What are the most complex files?”  
> “How do these modules connect?”

Gemini responds contextually — as if your repo itself could talk back.

### 📊 Code Analytics
Gain insights from your repo structure:
- Lines of Code (LOC) per file  
- Code complexity (loops, conditionals, etc.)  
- Commit frequency from Git history  
- Folder-level clustering visualization
